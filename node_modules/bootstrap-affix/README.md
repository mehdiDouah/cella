# Bootstrap 4 with Affix plugin

Bootstrap 4 drops the Affix jQuery plugin. They recommend using a `position: sticky` polyfill instead. See the [HTML5 Please](http://html5please.com/#sticky) entry for details and specific polyfill recommendations. If you were using Affix to apply additional, non-position styles, the polyfills might not support your use case. One option for such uses is the third-party [ScrollPos-Styler](https://github.com/acch/scrollpos-styler) library.

Alternatively this template will show you how to use the Bootstrap 3 plugin with Bootstrap 4.

These pages can also include HTML partials, external Handlebars helpers, or external data as JSON or YAML.
